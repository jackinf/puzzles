# Amazon letter challenge

Having a ordered sequence of letters, split the letters into arrays so that the letter is not being repeated in other arrays.
Arrays should be minimum in size, if possible.

Examples:
```
"abacd" -> ["aba"], ["c"], ["d"]
"abcd" -> ["a"], ["b"], ["c"], ["d"]
"abacdfgdy" -> ["aba", "c", "dfgd", "y"]
```
